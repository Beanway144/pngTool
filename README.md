# PNG Tool
Quickly written Python script that removes all white pixels from all PNGs in a directory. For mass removing backgrounds for illustrations for my website :)
## How to use
`python3 pngTool.py /this/is/a/path/to/a/directory`
## Warning
This script overwrites old PNG files. There's no error handling/input handling etc. so use at own risk
